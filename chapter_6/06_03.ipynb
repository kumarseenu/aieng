    "Fusion approaches retrieve documents separately with each method, then combine the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple fusion**: Taking the union of results from multiple retrievers\n",
    "- **Weighted fusion**: Adjusting scores from each retriever and combining them\n",
    "- **Reciprocal rank fusion**: Considering the rank position of documents in each result set\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ensemble Approaches\n",
    "Ensemble approaches use multiple retrievers in series or with more complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential retrieval**: Using one retriever's output as input to another\n",
    "- **Filter-then-rank**: Using one method to create a candidate pool, another to rank\n",

    "1. **Choosing weights**: Start with equal weights and adjust based on the query types you see in your application. If users frequently use keywords, increase BM25 weight; if they ask natural language questions, favor vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance considerations**: The fusion approach requires running both retrievers, which can be more expensive. In production, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Running retrievers in parallel\n",
    "    - Using a faster first-stage retriever (typically BM25) to filter candidates\n",
    "    - Caching results for common queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Beyond simple weighting**: More sophisticated approaches include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using machine learning to learn optimal weights\n",
    "    - Adjusting weights dynamically based on query type\n",
    "    - Implementing reciprocal rank fusion, which considers result positions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Always evaluate your hybrid approach on a diverse set of queries to ensure it's performing better than either method alone."

    "In this notebook, we've explored different approaches to hybrid retrieval, combining the strengths of BM25 lexical search and vector-based semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "- Simple fusion provides an easy way to combine results but doesn't rerank them\n",
    "- Weighted fusion offers more control over the balance between approaches\n",
    "- The best configuration depends on your specific use case and query patterns\n",
    "- Hybrid approaches generally outperform either method alone across diverse query types\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing hybrid retrieval, you can create more robust information retrieval systems that work well for both keyword searches and natural language queries."
